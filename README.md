# M-Kronig-MSc-Final-Project
M Kronig (23029039) CSC-40098 Final Project (SS3)


The Project

In this project I will be applying data analysis techniques to answer the question, 'What questions are computer science educators asking?'.

The goal is to understand the problems CS Educators are facing, key topics of discussion that they are engaging in and discover insights that can potentially offer solutions to these issues.

Core tools used so far:
VSCode with Python and Jupyter Notebooks, SQL for data collection and querying. Core analysis focused on text-based analysis with Topic Modeling.
