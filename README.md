# M-Kronig-MSc-Final-Project
M Kronig (23029039) CSC-40098 Final Project (SS3)

** This README file will be updated as the project progresses

The Project

In this project I will be applying data analysis techniques to answer the question, 'What questions are computer science educators asking?'.

The goal is to understand the problems CS Educators are facing, key topics of discussion that they are engaging in and discover insights that can potentially offer solutions to these issues.

Core tools used so far:
VSCode with Python and Jupyter Notebooks, SQL for data collection and querying, Tableau for final data visualisations

Method & Process

(In process)

Timeframe

Weeks 1 & 2: Project Set-Up
•	Initial project set-up, getting together the tools and software needed to complete all stages of the project having identified key goals and outcomes required to complete the project
•	Explore alternative methods for data collection, transformation and visualisation to allow for options and adaptation as project develops
•	Complete all required readings, lectures and peer discussions required for weeks 1 & 2, as well as reading through all units and key assignment requirements

Weeks 3 – 5: Data Collection
•	Familiarise with CS Educators Stack exchange website and the Schema for the SQL queries required to collect data
•	Perform SQL queries to do initial data exploration and understand the data, identifying key features
•	Convert collected data to CSV format for easier handling

Weeks 6 – 8: Data Cleaning & Poster session (Week 8)
•	Check for errors/missing values as well as duplicate or irrelevant data to be removed
•	Standardise text (from the posts) in transform to best suit exploratory data analysis
•	Save new cleaned version of data separately ready to read into Jupyter Notebook for Python analysis
•	Work through poster session in week 8 and begin work on poster design

Weeks 9 – 12: Exploratory Data Analysis & Poster session (Week 11)
•	Use data analysis with Python to explore the dataset and identify key themes and patterns
•	Gather key statistics ready for data visualisation
•	Utilise various text-based analysis methods with Python for sentiment analysis
•	Analyse trends over time to discover changes in trends and key topics
•	Generate ad-hoc data visualisations for EDA
•	Work through Poster workshop in week 11
•	Progress Poster completed and submitted by 19/05/25

Weeks 13 – 15: Data Visualisation
•	Prepare and upload data to visualisation platform
•	Create final data visualisations, considering design and clarity to best communicate findings
•	Interpret findings ready for final report

Weeks 16 – 18: Summarise findings
•	Summarise the key findings from the analysis
•	Compare with findings from initial research in CSC-40100 (Literature review)
•	Record the main implications of the findings and the impact on CS Education
•	Provide any recommendations based on insights

Weeks 19 – 21: Write up final report
•	Structure final report with core stages and sections
•	Write up each section, including data visualisations and code where needed
•	Link back to research completed in module CSC-40100 and compare findings
•	Summarise key findings and recommendations

Weeks 22 – 24: Proofread and final review + Presentation video if required
•	Proofread through report and edit where needed for clarity
•	Prepare video presentation if need to go alongside the written report
•	Submit final report by deadline (01/09/25)
